Adblock rules for saving times on addicting websites

If you want to contribute - suggest a rule in timecatcher.txt - if I like it I add it.
If I know and trust you or you have a few good contributions then I add you as contributer.

If you are a contributer use push.sh "meaningful commit message" to push after you edit the -dev.txt file! Don't edit the .txt file directly as the hash wont work.
